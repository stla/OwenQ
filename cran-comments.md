# Release version 1.0.4 (2021-09-19)

## Release summary 

The CRAN checks find two kind of errors with the Mac platform. They also occur 
on R-hub on the "macos-m1-bigsur-release" platform. First kind of errors: near 
equalities does not hold; I have relaxed the equality tolerance to 1e-15. 
Second kind of error: the function `OwenQ2` gives `NaN` for `R = 0`; I skip 
the concerned tests on Mac.
